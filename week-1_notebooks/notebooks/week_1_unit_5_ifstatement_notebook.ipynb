    "# Conditional Statements - Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "All the programs we have written so far follow a simple sequence of statements. \n",
    "After the program starts, each statement is executed step by step until the \n",
    "program ends. However, in many cases, certain parts of a program should only \n",
    "run under specific conditions. Consider the following scenario and how it could be \n",
    "expressed as [pseudo code](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode):\n",
    "\n",
    "> If it rains tomorrow, I will clean up the basement. Then I will tidy the \n",
    "> cupboards and sort the photos. Otherwise, I will go swimming. In the evening, \n",
    "> I will go to the cinema with my wife.\n",
    "\n",
    "This natural language description is imprecise. Often, in spoken language, \n",
    "additional information is conveyed through context. What is likely meant in the \n",
    "example above is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "   If it rains tomorrow, I will:\n",
    "      - clean up the basement\n",
    "      - tidy the cupboards\n",
    "      - sort the photos\n",
    "   Otherwise (so if it doesn't rain), I will:\n",
    "      - go swimming.\n",
    "\n",
    "   In the evening I will go to the cinema with my wife.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the weather, the program follows one of two possible paths. This \n",
    "is illustrated in the following diagram:\n",
    "\n",
    "![img_conditionals.png](./img/img_conditionals.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable such a decision-based workflow, two components are necessary:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A structure that allows the program to branch into different paths based on \n",
    "   a given condition.  \n",
    "2. A method for specifying conditions.\n"

    "## Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a condition? In essence, it is something that evaluates to either \n",
    "`True` or `False`. In other words, a condition always results in a `bool` \n",
    "value. Technically, you could use `True` or `False` directly when a condition is \n",
    "required. However, this is not flexible — `True` is always true. More useful \n",
    "conditions involve comparing variables with given values. For example, consider an \n",
    "integer variable `age`. The value of `age` may be equal to `18` or not. Checking \n",
    "whether *age is equal to 18* results in either \n",
    "`True` or `False`. Python provides several comparison operators that can be used with both \n",
    "numerical and string data types. When comparing numbers, the usual numerical \n",
    "ordering applies. For strings, comparisons follow alphabetical order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "To make decisions in programs, we need a way to define conditions. Python's \n",
    "comparison operators allow us to formulate these conditions. The table below \n",
    "shows common comparison operators, along with examples that evaluate to `True` \n",
    "or `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Operator | Explanation                          | Example `True` | Example `False` |\n",

    "| `==`     | Equal to                            | `2 == 2`       | `2 == 3`        |\n",
    "| `!=`     | Not equal to                        | `2 != 3`       | `2 != 2`        |\n",
    "| `<`      | Less than                           | `2 < 3`        | `2 < 1`         |\n",
    "| `>`      | Greater than                        | `3 > 2`        | `2 > 3`         |\n",
    "| `<=`     | Less than or equal to               | `3 <= 3`       | `3 <= 2`        |\n",
    "| `>=`     | Greater than or equal to            | `2 >= 2`       | `2 >= 3`        |\n",
    "\n",
    "### `=` vs. `==`\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to distinguish between `=` and `==`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A single equal sign (`=`) is used for **assignment**. It assigns a value to a \n",
    "  variable. An assignment does not return a value and is neither `True` nor \n",
    "  `False`.  \n",
    "- A double equal sign (`==`) is used for **comparison**. It checks whether the \n",
    "  values on both sides are equal. This comparison returns either `True` or \n",
    "  `False`, but it does not modify the values being compared.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Complex Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "What if you need to check whether `age` is greater than `18` but less than \n",
    "`30`? In such cases, you can build complex conditions using Boolean operators like \n",
    "`and`, `or`, and `not` (refer to the notebook on data types for details).\n"
