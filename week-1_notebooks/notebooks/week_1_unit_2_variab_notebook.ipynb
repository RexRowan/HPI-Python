    "# Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding variables is essential in programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost every programming language includes variables. However, in programming, \n",
    "the concept of a variable differs from its mathematical definition. In \n",
    "programming, a variable serves as a reference to a value. From a basic \n",
    "technical perspective, a variable is a designated space in memory that holds \n",
    "a value at a given point in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using variables\n",
    "\n",
    "A value can be assigned or stored in a variable. Similarly, the stored value \n",
    "can be retrieved when needed. *(Important: Retrieving a variable’s value does \n",
    "not remove or change it!)*\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable's value is assigned using the `=` operator. For example, the \n",
    "statement `a = 2` assigns the value `2` to the variable `a`. In later \n",
    "statements, if `a` is used, it holds the assigned value. Consider the \n",
    "example in the following code cell:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The value `2` is assigned to variable `a`.\n",
    "2. The value `3` is assigned to variable `b`.\n",
    "3. The values of `a` and `b` are retrieved and multiplied.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In mathematics, `a = 2` is an assertion that is either true or false. In \n",
    "> programming, `a = 2` is an instruction that assigns the value `2` to the \n",
    "> variable `a`.\n"
